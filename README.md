# HALS
Generalized harmonic least-squares amplitude and phase estimation method

Notes
-----
An optimisation approach which aims at minimizing the sum of the squared residuals when fitting
sinusoids of known frequencies to a time series of discrete measurements. Also included is a windowed linear detrend function with optional window overlap for pre-processing of non-uniformly sampled data.

Both of these functions are located in the HALS.py script and a use-case example can be found in the Jupiter Notebook 
HALS_example.ipynb
